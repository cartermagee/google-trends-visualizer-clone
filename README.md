##clone of google trends visualizer

[Carter's Clone](http://carters-trends-clone.surge.sh/)

###TODO

1. dynamically switch my font size calculations based off container size and not the window

2. highlight grid dimensions selector more like the real trends visualizer 

3. fix unmounting issue on resize of grid

##My Approach

I tried to copy the logic from Google Trends Visualizer as simply as possible using as much css and dynamic rendering as I could without overly relying on JS and React. With more time I could have done this more ellegantly but for an MVP this will do for now. Thanks for Looking!
